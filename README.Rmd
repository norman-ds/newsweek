# World's Best Hospitals 2021

This is the third year that Newsweek has partnered with Statista Inc, the respected global data research firm, to reveal the World's Best Hospitalsâ€” and it may be our most important ranking yet.

### DevOps

RStudio's IDE is launched in a Docker and accessed through the browser (http://localhost:8787).

```yaml
docker run --name newsweek -d -p 8787:8787 -v $(pwd):/home/rstudio -e PASSWORD=pwd rocker/verse:3.6.3
```

The Docker image from *rocker/verse* has R version 3.6.3 and some packages installed, saving us from having to reinstall.

```{R}
sessionInfo()
```

The version list of the used R packages.

```{R}
libs <- c("RCurl","curl","readr","dplyr","purrr","ggplot2","flexdashboard","DT","plotly")
ip <- installed.packages(fields = c("Package", "Version"))
ip <- ip[ip[,c("Package")] %in% libs,]
paste(ip[,c("Package")],ip[,c("Version")])
```
